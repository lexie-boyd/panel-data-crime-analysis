### 3) Additional Information
According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, violent crime includes the following four offenses:
1.	Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter – The willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human by another.
2.	Rape – Defined as penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the victim’s consent.
3.	Robbery – The taking or attempting to take anything of value from a person by force, threat of force, or violence.
4.	Aggravated Assault – An unlawful attack intended to inflict severe bodily injury, often involving a weapon.
Violent crimes are defined as those involving force or the threat of force against a person.


Data Collection & Hierarchy Rule

•	The FBI’s Hierarchy Rule states that if multiple crimes occur in a single incident, only the most serious offense is recorded in the official report.

•	Violent crimes are ranked in order of severity:

o	Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter

o	Rape

o	Robbery

o	Aggravated Assault

Data and Variable Explanation 
1) State - Name of the U.S. state
2) Violent Crime Rate - Number of reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents
3) Property Crime Rate - Number of reported property crimes per 100,000 		residents
-	Each state’s violent crime rate is calculated by dividing the total number of reported violent crimes by the state population then multiplying by 100,000.

## American Community Survey

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an annual survey conducted by the US Census Bureau from a sample of about 3.5 million households across the United 	States.


### Data Collection and Processing

### Data and Variable Explanation

a)	Educational Attainment for Population 25 Years 
 
The data within the table is fairly self-explanatory with the first number for each state representing the total amount of people and the second number for each state representing the percentage of the population. We care about the percentage of the highlighted column. We will look at percentages to keep the units' uniform between all states and focus on the percentage of the population that are college graduates. 

b)	Unemployment Rate for Civilian Population in Labor Force 16 Years and Over
 
This data focuses on the U6 unemployment rate. We will again be looking at the percentages in the unemployment column to keep our units’ uniform across the different states. 

c)	Median Household Income (In [specific years] Inflation Adjusted Dollars)

Captures data regarding a key economic indicator that reflects the financial well-being of households by accounting for inflation, allowing for meaningful comparisons across different years. It is crucial for assessing income distribution, economic inequality, and overall economic growth within a population.

d)	Marital Status for the Population 15 Years and Older 

We are looking at the proportion of the population within each state that is currently married. This includes only the population of 15 years and over and does not include those who were separated, divorced, or widowed.
